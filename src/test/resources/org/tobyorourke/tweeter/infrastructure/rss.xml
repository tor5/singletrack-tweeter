            <description>&#60;p&#62;Hi wanted to do a bit of a collage picture thing with some pictures. Went on photobucket and it only accepts one photo at a time. OMG its like software from a decade ago!&#60;br /&#62;
                Anyone recommend something better?

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Looking at heading to Australia in July for 2 weeks, unfortunately due to work commitments got quite specific dates that I have to go on. &#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Has anyone got any experience on where to get the cheapest flights?  Internet searches at the moment are returning flights at around the £1k mark.

            <description>&#60;p&#62;The answer is 2900 against 3380 according to my calculator but.......&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;I was looking for a trail bike full susser, and after borrowing rides of various bikes I had kinda settled on the Giant Maestro system as my preferred option. The bike I rode that hooked me was a 26er Anthem, albeit it was in a large and I need a medium. I do quite a bit of riding in the Lakes so I was looking at a Trance 26er in a medium. I sat on one in a shop and it just didn't feel right for me. I sat on an Anthem 29er and that felt right straight away, but I'm not sure it's the right bike for my intended use!!!&#60;br /&#62;
                (The Trance 29er just seems to have the seat too far back over the stays which I know from experience will hurt my knees, and my knees have been in crisis recently so I don't want to risk it)&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;The question is..... will the Anthem 29er do the Walna Scar, will it do Parkamoor to Nibthwaite?&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Obviously the answer is to get a demo bike and try it out, but in the meantime I'd welcome any input from folk who've ridden an Anthem 29er over Lakeland trails.

            <description>&#60;p&#62;I want to get a new camera, one that charges the battery through a USB cable (rather than a dedicated take the battery out type charger).  I'm struggling to find a list of what cameras do that and even when looking on the manufacturers websites they offer conflicting infomation.&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;anyone have any clues or advice?&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;I need;&#60;br /&#62;

                about 14MP&#60;br /&#62;
                compact&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;for multi-day, even multi-week rides&#60;/p&#62;

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Ok, so I seem to have got a great new job (hooray!) in the city my girlfriend and I want to settle in/near. We're planning on living out Wylam way and I'd like to commute by bike to the town centre (station end of Westgate Rd).&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;First up, obviously the paths along the river are great for a sunday pootle but I've not really used them for getting to and from the city. Do they choke up at rush hour and are they usable most of the year? Would they be road bike friendly or is this a great excuse for a CXer?&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Secondly, I'm not sure that the place I'm working at has bike storage, what are bike parking options in town like? If theft/damage a major issue? Can you use the station platform racks without buying a ticket?&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Cheers,&#60;br /&#62;

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;The Queen is sending me on an all-expenses paid 6 month trip to somewhere non bike friendly (&#34;what tyres for land mines?&#34; thread to follow) so they will be stuck in the garage.  So, do I need to do anything to them before I go?&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;I've heard of storing them upside down, draining the brakes, letting air out of shocks etc so any advice great fully received.&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Ta&#60;/p&#62;

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Testing the water, I'm after an XT crankset in nice nick. With or without rings, but it needs granny tabs as I want to make it 2x. I'd like it to be heel rub free, not too bothered about the odd rock strike. What's out there?  Email wholestonedaveATaolDOTcom

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Is there a word that descrpibes the use of say word A to describe word B but word A has the opposite meaning...I'll explain..&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Doctor asks..&#34; how are you finding your new diet &#34;?&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Teenage patient..&#34; it's phat &#34;&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Or&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Waiter to teen &#34; how's your food? &#34;&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;Teen &#34; Sick &#34; ( means awesome )&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;I thought of these two today whilst preparing tea. I'm sure there must be others but can't think of any, and these two are modern variants that would of only come about the last few years.

                &#60;p&#62;So today on that there Groupon, there is an offer for Online Weight Watchers, 3 months, 18 quid. Just wondering if anyone had tried it with any success?&#60;/p&#62;
                &#60;p&#62;I know, go out on bike, eat less and all that, but I'm one of those people that needs a regiment to stick to

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Please talk to me about your favourite trail that threads it's way through the mountains by way of high passes, photo's would be grand,  I guess mine would be the tour of Gable, although I eagerly await the spring and a shot at the Torridon corrie Lair circuit, this will be hard to beat i'm sure.

            <description>&#60;p&#62;A long shot, but does anyone have a pair of SIDs with a 220mm steerer going spare? Ideally I'm looking to pay under £200 and have them in a colour that's not white, but beggars can't be choosers. Other 100mm lightweight XC forks also considered.
